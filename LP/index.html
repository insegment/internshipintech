				<h1><b>KNOWLEDGE IS THE ULTIMATE WEAPON</b></h1>
				<p>DDoS attacks can be large and have an immediate impact to your organization. They can also be subtle and difficult to detect, making your applications and existing security infrastructure such as firewalls and IPS vulnerable. Knowing what kind of tactics attackers use is the first step in detecting them, protecting yourself.</p>

					<h1>Volumetric Attacks</h1>
					<p>These attacks are bent on causing congestion. They are large bandwidth consuming attacks that not only overwhelm a target's Internet facing circuits, they  also cause significant collateral damage in shared network environments.</p>

					<h1>TCP State-Exhaustion Attacks</h1>
					<p>Millions of connections can be taken down by this kind of attack, even high capacity devices. These attacks are designed to exhaust the TCP state table in devices like firewalls, load balancers, IPS, web servers and other devices that are required to track TCP state. etc.</p>

					<h1>Application Layer Attacks</h1>
					<p>These are the most deadly kind of attacks, as they can be very effective with as few as one attacking machine generating a low traffic rate—making them very difficult to pro-actively detect and mitigate.These attacks have become one of the most common DDoS attacks seen in the wild.</p>

					<h1>The Triple Threat Attack</h1>
					<p>Today’s sophisticated attackers are blending volumetric, state exhaustion and application-layer attacks against infrastructure devices all in a single, sustained attack. These attacks are popular because they’re difficult to defend against and require a layered approach to DDoS protection.</p>
